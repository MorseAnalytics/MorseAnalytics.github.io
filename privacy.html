<h4 id="Why-we-need-your-data"><a href="#Why-we-need-your-data" class="headerlink" title="Why we need your data"></a>Why we need your data</h4><p>We need to know your basic personal data in order to fulfil any contracts we have with you, and provide you with on-going organisational updates and analysis services.

<h4 id="What-we-do-with-your-data"><a href="#What-we-do-with-your-data" class="headerlink" title="What we do with your data"></a>What we do with your data</h4><p>All the personal data is processed in the UK.

<h2 id="Processing-client-data"><a href="#Processing-client-data" class="headerlink" title="Processing client data"></a><a name="data"></a>Processing client data</h2><p>Morse Analytics is frequently contracted to act as a processor of personal data on behalf of clients. In circumstances where we are commissioned to work with personal data as a ‘Processor’ when the client is the ‘Controller’, we will establish a contract with the client that will outline the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>we will only act on the written instructions of the client;</li>
<li>we are subject to a duty of confidence;</li>
<li>we will take appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing;</li>
<li>we will only engage sub-processors with the prior consent of the client and under a written contract;</li>
<li>we will assist the client in providing subject access and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR;</li>
<li>we will assist the client in meeting its GDPR obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches and data protection impact assessments;</li>
<li>we will delete or return all personal data to the client as requested at the end of the contract; and</li>
<li>we will submit to audits and inspections, provide the client with whatever information it needs to ensure that they are both meeting their Article 28 obligations, and tell the client immediately if it is asked to do something infringing the GDPR or other data protection law of the EU or a member state.</li>
